# McM running in Python 3

This version is updated to run using: Python 3.11

The dependencies are also updated. Please see `requirements.txt`

To test this, one isolated McM version was deployed to behave like the current development instance.

To check compatibility and "correctness", only the following system tests were executed: [Include "end-to-end" injection test cases](https://github.com/cms-PdmV/cmsPdmV/pull/1137).

Therefore, consider this version as an `preview` running version of McM in Python 3.

Please have in mind that validations were not tested nor integrations with other PdmV applications like: Stats2.

Auxiliary modules like `wmcontrol` and `wmupload` maybe are still running in Python 2
